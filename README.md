## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kamillah!

**ðŸŽ“ Rising senior at George Mason University, studying Computer Science**

**ðŸ”­ Aspiring Data Scientist**

- I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. Iâ€™m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as an AI fellow for Google and a Software Engineer at Capital One!). Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!

### ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: YouTube Trending Video Analysis  

- **What We Did:** Analyzed YouTube trending video data to uncover factors driving popularity. Preprocessed metadata and text using Gensim, engineered features (views/likes/comments per day, day differences), and built a Random Forest Regressor to predict views per day.  

- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Gensim, Matplotlib  

- **Result:** Achieved 0.069 MSE and 0.71 R-squared, identifying key predictors like publish-to-trend time and engagement metrics. Provided actionable insights into YouTube trends.

### ðŸš€ Projects:
A few other noteworthy projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

1. **My Cornell Portfolio**

- Focuses on building a machine learning model to classify book reviews as "Positive" or "Negative." It demonstrates the full lifecycle of a machine learning project, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Pandas 
- **Learnings**: Implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for high-dimensional data classification problems, Insights into the importance of data preprocessing techniques like lowercasing, punctuation removal, and digit elimination.

2. **Uber ML Project** 

- Involves analyzing Uber trip data to forecast demand and optimize pricing strategies. It uses machine learning models to predict the number of trips for a given time and location. 
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet), Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
- **Learnings**: Data preprocessing and feature engineering for time series data, data visualization, Model selection and evaluation for forecasting tasks.
